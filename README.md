<h4 align="center">Why crack hashes when you can bust them?</h4>


![demo](https://image.ibb.co/fnXWBe/Screenshot_2018_09_20_14_02_05.png)

## Features
- Automatic hash type identification
- Supports MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512
- Can extract & crack hashes from a file
- Can find hashes from a directory, recursively
- Multi-threading

## Insallation & Usage
> **Note:** Hash Buster isn't compatible with python2, run it with python3 instead.
> Also, Hash-Buster uses some APIs for hash lookups, check the source code if you are paranoid.

Hash-Buster can be run directly from the python script but I highly suggest you to install it with `make install`

After the installation, you will be able to access it with `buster` command.

### Cracking a single hash

You don't need to specify the hash type. Hash Buster will identify and *crack* it under 3 seconds.

**Usage:** `buster -s <hash>`
### Finding hashes from a directory

Yep, just specify a directory and Hash Buster will go through all the files and directories present in it, looking for hashes.

**Usage:** `buster -d /root/Documents`
### Cracking hashes from a file

Hash Buster can find your hashes even if they are stored in a file like this

```

**Usage:** `buster -f /root/hashes.txt`

### Specifiying number of threads

Multi-threading can incredibly minimize the overall speed when you have a lot of hashes to crack by making requests in parallel.

`buster -f /root/hashes.txt -t 10`
